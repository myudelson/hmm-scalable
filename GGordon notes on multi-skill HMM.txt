= Meeting with G.Gordon 2012-05-01, BKT HMM with multi-skill coding =

another hidden variable that governs blame in case of error
if correct - all correct
if incorrect

R1..Rk - skill right
R - problem right

sigma - problem slip 
gamma - problem guess
p(R|R1..Rk) = 1-sigma
p(R|at least one wrong) = gamma
p(R1…Rk|R) = p(R|R1..Rk)*p(R1…Rk) / pR praise everyone
p(R1…Rk|~R) = = p(~R|R1..Rk)*p(R1…Rk) / p~R - whom to blame

do these up to n==5 skills

table of all of the R1…Rk marginalize and get p(Ri|R), p(Ri|~R)

use these as proportions (continuous), or do a version of Veterbi to come up with most likely 

^^^ ALL THIS is forward version 

THIS WHOLE THING = Message passing / belief propagation algorithm =

sigma :: regress R~R1...Rk, gamma :: regress !R~R1...Rk

fix sigma and gamma: sigma = mean( p(Si) ), gamma = mean( p(Gi) )

this approach is "variational approximation" and becomes "conjunctive knowledge tracing" (Ken)
